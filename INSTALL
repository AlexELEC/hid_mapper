Basic building:
===============

Go to the source directory then type from your shell:

    ./make
    sudo make install

This will build the `hid_mapper` binary file in
the current directory and install the various
files:

 - `hid_mapper` will go into `/usr/bin`
 - startup script will go into `/etc/init.d`
 - default config will go into `/etc/default`
 - maps will go into `/usr/share/hid-mapper/map`

Debian (binary) package:
========================

Go to the source directory then type from your shell:

    ./make deb

This will produce a binary Debian package in the current
directory. This package may be then installed using `dpkg -i`:

    dpkg -i hid-mapper-2.1.0-amd64.deb

The binary will be installed into `/usr/bin`
The maps in `/usr/share/hid-mapper/maps`
The startup script in `/etc/init.d`...

... and the configuration file in `/etc/default/hid-mapper`
(set your `product`, `manufacturer` and `map` in that later file).

To start/stop/restart the daemon, do as usual:

    /etc/init.d/hid-mapper {start|stop|restart}

Or:

    invoke-rc.d hid-mapper {start|stop|restart}
